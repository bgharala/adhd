<h1>Internet of Things for Smart Cities</h1>

<p>
The Internet of Things (IoT) shall be able to incorporate transparently and seamlessly a large number of different and heterogeneous end systems, while providing open access to selected subsets of data for the development of a plethora of digital services. Building a general architecture for the IoT is hence a very complex task, mainly because of the extremely large variety of devices, link layer technologies, and services that may be involved in such a system. In this paper, we focus specifically to an urban IoT system that, while still being quite a broad category, are characterized by their specific application domain. Urban IoTs, in fact, are designed to support the Smart City vision, which aims at exploiting the most advanced communication technologies to support added-value services for the administration of the city and for the citizens. This paper hence provides a comprehensive survey of the enabling technologies, protocols, and architecture for an urban IoT. Furthermore, the paper will present and discuss the technical solutions and best-practice guidelines adopted in the Padova Smart City project, a proof-of-concept deployment of an IoT island in the city of Padova, Italy, performed in collaboration with the city municipality.

<p class=MsoNormal>SECTION I.Introduction<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>THE Internet of Things (IoT) is a recent communication
paradigm that envisions a near future, in which the objects of everyday life
will be equipped with microcontrollers, transceivers for digital communication,
and suitable protocol stacks that will make them able to communicate with one
another and with the users, becoming an integral part of the Internet [1]. The
IoT concept, hence, aims at making the Internet even more immersive and
pervasive. Furthermore, by enabling easy access and interaction with a wide
variety of devices such as, for instance, home appliances, surveillance
cameras, monitoring sensors, actuators, displays, vehicles, and so on, the IoT
will foster the development of a number of applications that make use of the potentially
enormous amount and variety of data generated by such objects to provide new
services to citizens, companies, and public administrations. This paradigm
indeed finds application in many different domains, such as home automation,
industrial automation, medical aids, mobile healthcare, elderly assistance,
intelligent energy management and smart grids, automotive, traffic management,
and many others [2].<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>However, such a heterogeneous field of application makes the
identification of solutions capable of satisfying the requirements of all
possible application scenarios a formidable challenge. This difficulty has led
to the proliferation of different and, sometimes, incompatible proposals for
the practical realization of IoT systems. Therefore, from a system perspective,
the realization of an IoT network, together with the required backend network
services and devices, still lacks an established best practice because of its
novelty and complexity. In addition to the technical difficulties, the adoption
of the IoT paradigm is also hindered by the lack of a clear and widely accepted
business model that can attract investments to promote the deployment of these
technologies [3].<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In this complex scenario, the application of the IoT
paradigm to an urban context is of particular interest, as it responds to the
strong push of many national governments to adopt ICT solutions in the
management of public affairs, thus realizing the so-called Smart City concept
[4]. Although there is not yet a formal and widely accepted definition of
“Smart City,” the final aim is to make a better use of the public resources,
increasing the quality of the services offered to the citizens, while reducing
the operational costs of the public administrations. This objective can be pursued
by the deployment of an urban IoT, i.e., a communication infrastructure that
provides unified, simple, and economical access to a plethora of public
services, thus unleashing potential synergies and increasing transparency to
the citizens. An urban IoT, indeed, may bring a number of benefits in the
management and optimization of traditional public services, such as transport
and parking, lighting, surveillance and maintenance of public areas,
preservation of cultural heritage, garbage collection, salubrity of hospitals,
and school.11 Furthermore, the availability of different types of data,
collected by a pervasive urban IoT, may also be exploited to increase the
transparency and promote the actions of the local government toward the
citizens, enhance the awareness of people about the status of their city,
stimulate the active participation of the citizens in the management of public
administration, and also stimulate the creation of new services upon those
provided by the IoT [5]. Therefore, the application of the IoT paradigm to the
Smart City is particularly attractive to local and regional administrations
that may become the early adopters of such technologies, thus acting as
catalyzers for the adoption of the IoT paradigm on a wider scale.<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The objective of this paper is to discuss a general
reference framework for the design of an urban IoT. We describe the specific
characteristics of an urban IoT, and the services that may drive the adoption
of urban IoT by local governments. We then overview the web-based approach for
the design of IoT services, and the related protocols and technologies,
discussing their suitability for the Smart City environment. Finally, we
substantiate the discussion by reporting our experience in the “Padova Smart
City” project, which is a proof-of-concept deployment of an IoT island in the
city of Padova (Italy) and interconnected with the data network of the city
municipality. In this regard, we describe the technical solutions adopted for
the realization of the IoT island and report some of the measurements that have
been collected by the system in its first operational days.<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section II
overviews the services that are commonly associated to the Smart City vision
and that can be enabled by the deployment of an urban IoT. Section III provides
a general overview of the system architecture for an urban IoT. More in detail,
this section describes the web service approach for the realization of IoT
services, with the related data formats and communication protocols, and the
link layer technologies. Finally, Section IV presents the “Padova Smart City”
project, which exemplifies a possible implementation of an urban IoT and
provides examples of the type of data that can be collected with such a
structure.<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>SECTION II.Smart City Concept and Services<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>According to Pike Research on Smart Cities,22 the Smart City
market is estimated at hundreds of billion dollars by 2020, with an annual
spending reaching nearly 16 billions. This market springs from the synergic
interconnection of key industry and service sectors, such as Smart Governance,
Smart Mobility, Smart Utilities, Smart Buildings, and Smart Environment. These
sectors have also been considered in the European Smart Cities project
(http://www.smart-cities.eu) to define a ranking criterion that can be used to
assess the level of “smartness” of European cities. Nonetheless, the Smart City
market has not really taken off yet, for a number of political, technical, and
financial barriers [6].<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Under the political dimension, the primary obstacle is the
attribution of decision-making power to the different stakeholders. A possible
way to remove this roadblock is to institutionalize the entire decision and
execution process, concentrating the strategic planning and management of the
smart city aspects into a single, dedicated department in the city [7].<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>On the technical side, the most relevant issue consists in
the noninteroperability of the heterogeneous technologies currently used in
city and urban developments. In this respect, the IoT vision can become the
building block to realize a unified urban-scale ICT platform, thus unleashing
the potential of the Smart City vision [8], [9].<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Finally, concerning the financial dimension, a clear
business model is still lacking, although some initiative to fill this gap has
been recently undertaken [10]. The situation is worsened by the adverse global
economic situation, which has determined a general shrinking of investments on
public services. This situation prevents the potentially huge Smart City market
from becoming reality. A possible way out of this impasse is to first develop
those services that conjugate social utility with very clear return on
investment, such as smart parking and smart buildings, and will hence act as
catalyzers for the other added-value services [10].<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In the rest of this section, we overview some of the
services that might be enabled by an urban IoT paradigm and that are of
potential interest in the Smart City context because they can realize the
win–win situation of increasing the quality and enhancing the services offered
to the citizens while bringing an economical advantage for the city
administration in terms of reduction of the operational costs [6]. To better
appreciate the level of maturity of the enabling technologies for these
services, we report in Table I a synoptic view of the services in terms of
suggested type(s) of network to be deployed, expected traffic generated by the
service, maximum tolerable delay, device powering, and an estimate of the
feasibility of each service with currently available technologies. From the
table, it clearly emerges that, in general, the practical realization of most
of such services is not hindered by technical issues, but rather by the lack of
a widely accepted communication and service architecture that can abstract from
the specific features of the single technologies and provide harmonized access
to the services.<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>TABLE I Services Specification for the Padova Smart City
Project<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Table <o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Structural Health of Buildings: Proper maintenance of the
historical buildings of a city requires the continuous monitoring of the actual
conditions of each building and identification of the areas that are most
subject to the impact of external agents. The urban IoT may provide a
distributed database of building structural integrity measurements, collected
by suitable sensors located in the buildings, such as vibration and deformation
sensors to monitor the building stress, atmospheric agent sensors in the
surrounding areas to monitor pollution levels, and temperature and humidity
sensors to have a complete characterization of the environmental conditions
[11]. This database should reduce the need for expensive periodic structural
testing by human operators and will allow targeted and proactive maintenance
and restoration actions. Finally, it will be possible to combine vibration and
seismic readings in order to better study and understand the impact of light
earthquakes on city buildings. This database can be made publicly accessible in
order to make the citizens aware of the care taken in preserving the city
historical heritage. The practical realization of this service, however,
requires the installation of sensors in the buildings and surrounding areas and
their interconnection to a control system, which may require an initial investment
in order to create the needed infrastructure.<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Waste Management: Waste management is a primary issue in
many modern cities, due to both the cost of the service and the problem of the
storage of garbage in landfills. A deeper penetration of ICT solutions in this
domain, however, may result in significant savings and economical and
ecological advantages. For instance, the use of intelligent waste containers,
which detect the level of load and allow for an optimization of the collector
trucks route, can reduce the cost of waste collection and improve the quality
of recycling [12].33 To realize such a smart waste management service, the IoT
shall connect the end devices, i.e., intelligent waste containers, to a control
center where an optimization software processes the data and determines the
optimal management of the collector truck fleet.<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Air Quality: The European Union officially adopted a
20-20-20 Renewable Energy Directive setting climate change reduction goals for
the next decade.44 The targets call for a 20% reduction in greenhouse gas
emissions by 2020 compared with 1990 levels, a 20% cut in energy consumption
through improved energy efficiency by 2020, and a 20% increase in the use of
renewable energy by 2020. To such an extent, an urban IoT can provide means to
monitor the quality of the air in crowded areas, parks, or fitness trails [13].
In addition, communication facilities can be provided to let health
applications running on joggers’ devices be connected to the infrastructure. In
such a way, people can always find the healthiest path for outdoor activities
and can be continuously connected to their preferred personal training
application. The realization of such a service requires that air quality and
pollution sensors be deployed across the city and that the sensor data be made
publicly available to citizens.<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Noise Monitoring: Noise can be seen as a form of acoustic
pollution as much as carbon oxide (CO) is for air. In that sense, the city
authorities have already issued specific laws to reduce the amount of noise in
the city centre at specific hours. An urban IoT can offer a noise monitoring
service to measure the amount of noise produced at any given hour in the places
that adopt the service [14]. Besides building a space-time map of the noise
pollution in the area, such a service can also be used to enforce public
security, by means of sound detection algorithms that can recognize, for
instance, the noise of glass crashes or brawls. This service can hence improve
both the quiet of the nights in the city and the confidence of public
establishment owners, although the installation of sound detectors or
environmental microphones is quite controversial, because of the obvious
privacy concerns for this type of monitoring.<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Traffic Congestion: On the same line of air quality and
noise monitoring, a possible Smart City service that can be enabled by urban
IoT consists in monitoring the traffic congestion in the city. Even though
camera-based traffic monitoring systems are already available and deployed in
many cities, low-power widespread communication can provide a denser source of
information. Traffic monitoring may be realized by using the sensing
capabilities and GPS installed on modern vehicles [15], and also adopting a
combination of air quality and acoustic sensors along a given road. This
information is of great importance for city authorities and citizens: for the
former to discipline traffic and to send officers where needed and for the
latter to plan in advance the route to reach the office or to better schedule a
shopping trip to the city centre.<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>City Energy Consumption: Together with the air quality
monitoring service, an urban IoT may provide a service to monitor the energy
consumption of the whole city, thus enabling authorities and citizens to get a
clear and detailed view of the amount of energy required by the different
services (public lighting, transportation, traffic lights, control cameras,
heating/cooling of public buildings, and so on). In turn, this will make it
possible to identify the main energy consumption sources and to set priorities
in order to optimize their behavior. This goes in the direction indicated by
the European directive for energy efficiency improvement in the next years. In
order to obtain such a service, power draw monitoring devices must be
integrated with the power grid in the city. In addition, it will also be
possible to enhance these service with active functionalities to control local
power production structures (e.g., photovoltaic panels).<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Smart Parking: The smart parking service is based on road
sensors and intelligent displays that direct motorists along the best path for
parking in the city [16]. The benefits deriving from this service are manifold:
faster time to locate a parking slot means fewer CO emission from the car,
lesser traffic congestion, and happier citizens. The smart parking service can
be directly integrated in the urban IoT infrastructure, because many companies
in Europe are providing market products for this application. Furthermore, by
using short-range communication technologies, such as Radio Frequency
Identifiers (RFID) or Near Field Communication (NFC), it is possible to realize
an electronic verification system of parking permits in slots reserved for
residents or disabled, thus offering a better service to citizens that can
legitimately use those slots and an efficient tool to quickly spot violations.<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Smart Lighting: In order to support the 20-20-20 directive,
the optimization of the street lighting efficiency is an important feature. In
particular, this service can optimize the street lamp intensity according to
the time of the day, the weather condition, and the presence of people. In
order to properly work, such a service needs to include the street lights into
the Smart City infrastructure. It is also possible to exploit the increased
number of connected spots to provide WiFi connection to citizens. In addition,
a fault detection system will be easily realized on top of the street light
controllers.<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Automation and Salubrity of Public Buildings: Another
important application of IoT technologies is the monitoring of the energy
consumption and the salubrity of the environment in public buildings (schools,
administration offices, and museums) by means of different types of sensors and
actuators that control lights, temperature, and humidity. By controlling these
parameters, indeed, it is possible to enhance the level of comfort of the
persons that live in these environments, which may also have a positive return
in terms of productivity, while reducing the costs for heating/cooling [17].</p>
