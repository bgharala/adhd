Prototype Functions for User Testing

1. Take a break task (implemented by Myco). User clicks this button to take a break from reading. In 10 minutes an aleart appears on the screen asking, "You have been taking a break for 10 minutes; would you like to return to your task?"

2. Background Noise (implemented by Gowtham). This button allows the user to turn on background noise while reading.

3. Reading Task (implemented by Brian). This feature allows users to click each paragraph to highlight as the user reads. Pressing a button, the user can move the hightlighted area to move to the next paragraph. 

Other goals future prototype: an option to turn on text to speech; a heartrate monitor to reduce frustration and distractions; an eye tracker to detect if user is falling asleep.
